Hello and welcome to my case study. Unfortunately, due to health problems in my family I could only spend 2 complete days on this assignment. 
-If I could spend more time, I would also add haptics, audio, more animations, particles, fonts and a chest animation.
-I only used art and assets provided on the Figma page and committed to sticking to the design layout that was provided. I did not focus on finding other assets elsewhere such as audio, particles or visuals.
-I designed a system based on the MVP architactural pattern where the visuals are Views, data are in Models and the the connection between Models and Views are managed in Presenters.
-The only external asset used was DOTween for animations.

The game loop:
1)Click on the buttons below to spawn a ball.
2)Ball spawns and hits pins and provide ball score.
3)The ball lands in a bucket and multiplies the ball score.
4)The ball score gets added to the total score. 
5) The bar fills. If the bar passes a threshold, a reward is given. Rewards are given at 33%, 66% and 100%.
6)Return to step 1.
